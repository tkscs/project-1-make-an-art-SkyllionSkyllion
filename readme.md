# Project Proposal

1. Roughly, what will your drawing look like
Flower

2. What are two variables you could use so that when you change each variable, the drawing changes?
size will change size of petal
count will change number of petals

3. Where is there repetition in your drawing?
the petals will repeat

4. What are the main parts of your drawing? Are there clear sections or objects?
main parts are the petals and the center of the flower

5. How could you use a loop variable of a for loop? Is there somewhere in your drawing where something is repeated, but it's slightly different each time? Maybe the same object is repeated in different places, or maybe a similar object is repeated but with different sizes?
repeating the petals and drawing the circle

the two functions are draw circle and draw petal

Currently, the two variables that work for count are 6 and 8 but I'm working on getting more to work
